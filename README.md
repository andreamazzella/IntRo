# IntRo: An introduction to R for health data

Markdown notebooks illustrating the basics of R, RStudio and the tidyverse for medical research, epidemiology & related fields. The datasets used are either simulated or in the public domain.

*Where to start*: after installing R and RStudio, download these files (Click the green "Code" button, "Download ZIP"), unzip, open `IntRo.Rproj` and `01_basics.qmd`. If you're familiar with Git, you can simply clone the repo.

NB - I'm currently restructuring this.

1. **The basics** (RStudio interface; using R scripts and Quarto documents; assigning values (`<-`); using functions, packages and datasets)
2. **Visualising** (Making bar charts, line charts, Box plots and scatterplots with `ggplot2`)
3. **Importing data** (importing and exporting data from/to file and from/to database)

3. **Data summaries** (Summarising continuous and categorical data; grouped summaries with `dplyr`, table 1 with `gtsummary`)
4.  **Data subsets** (Filtering rows and selecting columns with `dplyr` and base R)
5. **Data transformation** (Importing and exporting data; calculate new variables, categorise continuous variables, regroup a categorical variable)
6. **Data cleaning** (Deleting and renaming variables; data classes; factors; labelling and recoding values)
7. **Data reshaping** (Joining datasets; wide and long formats; reshaping wide to long and vice versa)
