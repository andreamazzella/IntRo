# IntRo: An introduction to R for health data
Markdown notebooks illustrating the basics of R, RStudio and the tidyverse for medical research, epidemiology & related fields. Simulated health data.

*Where to start*: after installing R and RStudio, download these files (Click the green "Code" button, "Download ZIP"), unzip, and open `intRo1 basics.Rmd`.

1. **The basics** (Using RStudio; R Markdown notebooks and R scripts; assignment (`<-`); using functions and datasets)
2. **Data visualisation** (Using packages; making bar charts, Box plots and scatterplots with `ggplot2`)
3. **Data summaries** (Summarising continuous and categorical data; grouped summaries with `dplyr`, table 1 with `gtsummary`)
4.  **Data subsets** (Filtering rows and selecting columns with `dplyr` and base R)
5. **Data transformation** (Importing and exporting data; calculate new variables, categorise continuous variables, regroup a categorical variable)
6. **Data cleaning** (Deleting and renaming variables; data classes; factors; labelling and recoding values)
7. **Data reshaping** (Joining datasets; wide and long formats; reshaping wide to long and vice versa)
8. **Data analysis of continuous outcomes** (data visualisation; t-test; linear regression)
9. **Data analysis of binary outcomes** (work in progress)
