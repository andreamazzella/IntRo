library("haven")     # import .dta datasets
library("lubridate") # dealing with dates

```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Let's import `diab_stata.dta` and let's have a look at the data.
```{r}
# Data import
dm <- read_stata("diab_stata.dta") %>% mutate_if(is.labelled, as_factor) # mutate_if adds value labels from the Stata format
summary(dm)
```


# Data manipulation

We might want to transform the data that we have to answer some specific questions. For example, we have date of births, but we don't have ages. BMI is continuous, but we might want to analyse it divided in clinical categories. Some strata have very few observations and we might want to group them together. 

## Calculate new variables

Let's start by creating a new variable with a simple calculation: height in metres. There are two ways of doing this; in both you need to assign with `<-` to make the operation permanent.
* In dplyr/tidyverse, you use function `mutate()` that is used to change a variable or create a new one, and you assign this new dataset to its own name.
* In base R, you expose the variable with `$`, you do the calculation, and you assign it to a new variable name.

```{r}
# dplyr
dm <- mutate(dm, height_m = height / 100)

# Base R
# dm$height_m <- dm$height / 100
```
NB: There is no output to this. If you want to check whether it worked, you can have a look at the dataset.

`%<>%` is another pipe from package magrittr. It combines the assignment operator `<-` and the forward pipe `%>%`, so it's used as shorthand instead of `data <- data %>%`. For example, we can replace the dplyr line of code above with:
```{r}
# mutate() with %<>%
# dm %<>% mutate(height_m2 = height / 100)

# mutate() with %>% 
# dm <- dm %>% mutate(height_m = height / 100)
```

*Exercise*
Convert weight into pounds (1kg = 2.20462 lbs).

(Note for Stata users: if you make a mistake and you want to recalculate the variable, you don't need to drop the old one first. When you assign it again, R will overwrite the old variable)
```{r new_variable}

```


Now let's suppose we want to recalculate the BMI, in order to have decimal figures (our dataset contains BMI as an integer).
```{r}
# Calculate BMI with decimals
dm %<>% mutate(bmi_dc = (weight / (height_m)^2))

# Check it worked
ggplot(dm, aes(bmi, bmi_dc)) + geom_point()

# Learn how to delete old variable in next session!
```


## Calculate age

Now we can calculate each observation's age as of 07/05/2020. Dealing with dates in all programming language is tricky, because they can be inputted in many different formats, with different (or no) delimiters between numbers. R codes all dates as days passed since the 1st of January 1970. Package "lubridate" (great name!) has some good functions for this.
```{r}
# Create a calculated age variable
dm %<>% mutate(age = ((dmy("7/5/2020") - date_birth) / 365.25) %>% # yr diff.ce
               as.numeric() %>%      # make it a number
               round(digits = 1))   # round it to 1 decimal digit
```

*Exercise*
Explore the distribution of age with a histogram.
```{r histogram}

```

## Categorise continuous variables

We might also want to transform a continuous variable into a categorical one, for example to reflect clinically meaningful groups. The function we nest in `mutate()` is `cut()`: the `breaks` indicate which values delimit groups, and `labels` indicate how each group be called.

```{r}
dm %<>% mutate(bmi_group = cut(bmi_dc,
                               breaks = c(0, 18.5, 25, 30, +Inf),
                               labels = c("underwt", "normal wt", "overwt", "obese")))

# The code below is used to check that the new variable was created correctly:
dm %>% group_by(bmi_group) %>% summarise("min BMI" = min(bmi_dc) %>% round(2),
                                         "max BMI" = max(bmi_dc) %>% round(2))
```
(I really recommend this paper on why categorising continuous variables is potentially problematic:
Turner E, Dobson J & Pocock S. (2010). "Categorisation of continuous risk factors in epidemiological publications: A survey of current practice." Epidemiologic perspectives & innovations ).

Now let's use this new categorised BMI for a plot. The ggplot function is `geom_boxplot()`.
```{r}
dm %>% filter(exercise_weekly > 0) %>% ggplot(aes(exercise_weekly, bmi_group)) + geom_boxplot()
```

We might also want to categorise according to quintiles, and not arbitrary breakpoints. We do this with function `ntile()`.

Let's transform the variable "exercise_weekly", containing minutes of exercise, into quintiles.

```{r}
# Create quintile variable
dm %<>% mutate(exer_quint = ntile(exercise_weekly, 5))

# Find the breakpoints
dm %>% group_by(exer_quint) %>% summarise(max(exercise_weekly))
```

*Exercise*
Categorise height with either `cut()` or `ntile()`.
```{r categorise}

```

## Group levels of a categorical variable

Sometimes we might need to group together two or more levels of a categorical variables, to avoid data sparcity.

The "disability" variable has only 17 observations in the "severe" stratum, and only 7 of these have the outcome of interest.

We can group together people with mild and severe disability. We do this with the `mutate()` and `ifelse()` functions.

```{r}
# Data exploration
dm %$% table(disability, diabetes)

# Regreoup
dm %<>% mutate(disabled = ifelse(disability == "able-bodied", "no", "yes"))

# Check it worked
dm %$% table(disability, disabled)
```

In order to categorise into three levels or more, you can either nest one `ifelse()` function into another, or use `case_when()`. `case_when()` takes a condition on the left, then a `~`, then the value to use on the right.

(The `~` sign can be inserted by pressing `Alt 126` in Windows, `Alt 5` with Mac)

For example, the first line of the `mutate()` function reads: create a new variable called "continent_2", and when the value in variable "continent" is "n_america", or when the continent is "s_america", insert the new value "americas".
```{r}
# Explore levels
table(dm$continent)

# Regroup
dm %<>% mutate(continent_2 = case_when(continent == "n_america" | continent == "s_america" ~ "americas",
                                       continent == "europe" | continent == "asia" ~ "eurasia",
                                       continent == "africa" ~ "africa",
                                       continent == "oceania" ~ "oceania"))
# Check it worked
dm %$% table(continent, continent_2)
```

There's another way of doing this, if you don't want to keep the original variable â€“ recoding values (we'll explore this in session 5).

*Exercise*
Reduce the levels of the sexual orientation variable with either `ifelse()` or `case_when()`.
```{r group_levels}

```

## Extra: Combine values of two categorical variables

We can also create a new categorical variables that summarises two other categorical variables.

For example, we can create a new variable, `minority`, that indicates if that person is part of any gender minority.

To do this, we use `mutate()` and `ifelse()` with two "or" statements, indicated by operator `|`. That bit of code means: "if gender is non-binary or trans, assign a value of "nb/trans"; else, assign a value of "cis m/f".
```{r}
# Crosstabulation
dm %$% table(gender)
dm %$% table(cistrans)

# Create the new variable
dm %<>% mutate(minority = ifelse(gender == "non-binary" | cistrans == "trans",
                                "nb/trans",
                                "cis m/f"))

# Check it worked
dm %$% table(minority, cistrans, gender, useNA = "ifany")
```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exporting/saving datasets

Whatever you do to the dataset, it doesn't change the original file. If you want to make some changes permanent, you need to use the `write_csv()` or `write_dta()` functions.
```{r}
# csv
dm %>% readr::write_csv("diab_csv_2.csv")

# Stata
dm %>% write_dta("diab_2.dta")
```

Note that .csv is a very simple format that does not keep information on labels, data types. More on this in the next session!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Recap exercise*
1. Import the `poo.csv` dataset
2. Explore the data.
2. Categorise the type of stool in the Bristol scale  into three levels: "constipation" (type 1-2), "normal" (type 3-5), "diarrhoea" (type 6-7).
3. Save a copy as `poo_v2.dta` so you can send it to your colleague Karen, who only uses STATA.

```{r recap}
# Import


# Explore


# Categorise


# Export


```
